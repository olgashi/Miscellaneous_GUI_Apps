          The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest
          living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. The giraffe has
          intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar
          appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and
          cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation
          of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated
          from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in
          numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016
          indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the
          wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.

        <figcaption>
          Green treefrogs reach 1 ¼ to 2 ½ inches long. Females tend to be
          larger than males. Their color varies from bright green to greenish
          gray or yellow green on back, with white or cream-colored stomach.
          Yellow or white stripes may run down the sides of its body, and gold
          spots may appear on its back. Sticky toe pads on its long toes are
          used for gripping.

        <figcaption>
          Leopards are larger than a house cat, but leopards are the smallest
          members of the large cat category. Leopards are solitary creatures
          that only spend time with others when they are mating or raising
          young. They are also nocturnal and spend their nights hunting instead
          of sleeping. Compared to other wild cats, the leopard has relatively
          short legs and a long body with a large skull. Its fur is marked with
          rosettes. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar (Panthera onca),
          but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally
          smaller, more densely packed and without central spots.

        <figcaption>
          Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes over 200
          species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an
          upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural
          hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight.
          Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious
          burrowing owl.

        <figcaption>
          Gulls, or colloquially seagulls, are seabirds of the family Laridae in
          the suborder Lari. Gulls are typically medium to large birds, usually
          grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They
          typically have harsh wailing or squawking calls; stout, longish bills;
          and webbed feet. Most gulls are ground-nesting carnivores which take
          live food or scavenge opportunistically, particularly the Larus
          species.

        <figcaption>
          A vulture is a bird of prey that scavenges on carrion. A particular
          characteristic of many vultures is a bald, unfeathered head. This bare
          skin is thought to keep the head clean when feeding, and also plays an
          important role in thermoregulation. Vultures have been observed to
          hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold, and open their
          wings and stretch their necks in the heat. They also urinate on
          themselves as a means of cooling their bodies

        <figcaption>
          A wallaby is a small or middle-sized macropod native to Australia and
          New Guinea, with introduced populations in New Zealand,[1] Hawaii, the
          United Kingdom and other countries. They belong to the same taxonomic
          family as kangaroos and sometimes the same genus, but kangaroos are
          specifically categorised into the four largest species of the family.
          The term "wallaby" is an informal designation generally used for any
          macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or a wallaroo that has not
          been designated otherwise.

        <figcaption>
          The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar
          fox, or snow fox, is a small fox native to the Arctic regions of the
          Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome. It
          is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for
          its thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage. Arctic foxes must
          endure a temperature difference of up to 90–100 °C (160–180 °F)
          between the external environment and their internal core temperature.
          To prevent heat loss, the Arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs
          and head under its body and behind its furry tail.

        <figcaption>
          Zebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive
          black-and-white striped coats. Zebras are primarily grazers and can
          subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by
          lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick.
          Zebras' dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable
          mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and
          beyond.
